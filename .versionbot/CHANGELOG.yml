      hash: d28e2456dff10b18bcc97b7232479fe78efd5eb3
      body: |
        Property type describes if the reference is 'strict' or 'informative'.

        Behaviour change only if type is informative otherwise default 'strict'.

        An informative reference is just an int field that points
        to another tables id field - like foreign key without constraints
        or foregein key cascades.
